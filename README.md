The ZeKKe Project
=================
ZeKKe is an orientation system for access in private spaces where no roads exist in systems like Google Maps or Bing Maps. The main goal of ZeKKe is to provide shortest routes between two places of interest in a private space and also give additional about these places by developing web applications and smart phone apps.

ZeKKe Project is based on my bachelor's thesis at Universidad de las Am√©ricas Puebla (http://bit.ly/1dIZyx0) and a paper I submitted at CONIELECOMP 2011 (http://bit.ly/15d8e7b).
